# pages to edit

## easy
- [x] 47 - "from left" caption
- [x] delete todo section
- [x] change "spacecraft applications" to "formation flying"
- [x] delete "near optimal" in title and other locations.  say that algorithm is derived from ML solution
- delete unrepresented pixels explanation

## medium
- [x] try to explain effects of assumptions
  - circular assumption
  - assumption that ground truth is equal to average of frames

## hard

- add more information when introducing phase correlation at end of derivation section

- [x] write abstract
- explain advantages of algorithm 
  - realtime (efficient)
  - non-iterative (fixed registration time)
  - parameterless
  - maybe put this in abstract/introduction as well as algorithm derivation section

- [x] empty section on normalized cross-correlation - delete?
- too much background info in "information based methods"

- [x] ensure each section flows smoothly into the next

- [x] explain when "information based methods" are appropriate - multimodal applications.  what are its limitations?
